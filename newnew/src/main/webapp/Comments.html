// SOMETIMES THE API WILL FAIL TO CONNECT TO MYSQL SERVER
	 // Steps to resolve:
	 
	 //A: Make sure the mysql server is running, here I used wamp.
	 //1. Download the mysql jdbc driver and unzip it (If you have not).
	 //2. Open the unzipped folder named mysql-connector-java-8.0.13(version as on today's date) and copy the executable jar //file named mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.
	 //3. Now if you are doing something with webapps(Using Tomcat server, eclipse, java ee), then go to the location where //tomcat files are placed and paste the jar file(mentioned in step 2) in the tomcat\bin\lib, for example in my case it is //C:\Users\ujjwa\Desktop\Practice\Winter\apache-tomcat-9.0.14\lib
	 //If not working with webapps, then ignore this step.
	 //4. Go to the locations where jdk and jre are installed and paste the jar file in the ext directory, for example in my //case they are
	 //C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_191\lib\ext
	 //C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_191\jre\lib\ext
	 //5. Then recompile the code using the command javac .java
	 //6. Then run the file. It should work fine as in my case it was displaying desired output. //

	 //B) Add following line of code just before the call to Connection.getConnection(url, props) method
	 //load and register JDBC driver for MySQL
	 //Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"); sometimes you will add the class not found  throws exception for each method //where the driver(Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");) is loaded
